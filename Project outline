Project outline


Goal: 

Find differences in how women and men are percived in music.
    - in general
    - does that vary over time?

1a. Approach
    I am analysing the top 100 Billboard songs from 1964-2015.

    First, I will classify songs into female and male. To obtain a set of songs with
    labels, I use LIWC dictionary to identify
    songs where the other gender is not mentioned. I enriched the LIWC dictionary with
    recent and slang words.  

    1. Find 10 top words correlating with female/male, Plot them over time
        - apply Liwc
        - split data into male/female based on she/he
        - train svm
        - show how words behave over time
    
b. Investigate which emotions are associated to female/male lyrics
    visualize it
    - find emotions attached to female/male. whats the ratio

2a. find most used gender words. plot how liwc cat behave over time
    - find top 3 categories per gender, plot over time
    - show top 10 all time words
    
b. LDA for female, male songs


Improvement. Look for bigrams/trigrams
